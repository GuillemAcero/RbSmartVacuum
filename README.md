And run the following to install the gems
```shell

## Server
Initialize the server using the following:

# Usage

## Available endpoints

### I personally recommend use Postman to test the endpoinds available:

* POST `localhost:3000/init`*

* POST `localhost:3000/get_dead_ends?room=<room-to-analize>`

* GET `localhost:3000/get_all`


\* For the `/init` endponid, it's necessary to send along with the request a JSON body with some restiction listed here:

* We asume that no furniture can be in the exit coordinates (0, n-1).
* We asume that furniture pieces donâ€™t overlap each other.
* This rule is alwaystrue: `0 <= start[0] <= end[0] and 0 <= start[1] <= end[1].`


A house sample could be the following:
```JSON
[
   {
      "room":"living_room",
      "m":3,
      "n":3,
      "furniture_count":1,
      "furniture":[
         {
            "name":"coach",
            "start":"(0,1)",
            "end":"(0,1)"
         }
      ]
   },
    {
      "room":"bedroom",
      "m":4,
      "n":6,
      "furniture_count":1,
      "furniture":[
         {
            "name":"desk",
            "start":"(0,1)",
            "end":"(0,3)"
         },
         {
            "name":"chair",
            "start":"(1,2)",
            "end":"(1,2)"
         }
      ]
   },
   {
      "room":"badi_example_room",
      "m":7,
      "n":7,
      "furniture_count":3,
      "furniture":[
         {
            "name":"lamp",
            "start":"(0,3)",
            "end":"(0,3)"
         },
         {
            "name":"bed",
            "start":"(1,1)",
            "end":"(1,4)"
         },
         {
            "name":"desk",
            "start":"(4,4)",
            "end":"(5,5)"
         }
      ]
   }
]
```
